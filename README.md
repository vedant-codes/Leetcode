# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository**! 🚀 This repository contains all the problems I have solved on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), with each solution saved as a separate file.

## 📂 Repository Structure


- Each file is named in the format `ProblemID-ProblemName.<extension>`.  
  - Example: `0001-TwoSum.c`
- Solutions are directly stored in the root directory for simplicity.

## 📝 How to Use

1. Browse the repository for the problem you’re interested in.  
2. Each solution file contains the complete implementation.  
3. For problem descriptions and explanations, refer to the corresponding problem on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).
